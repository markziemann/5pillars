Dear Editor,

Reproducibility is an essential feature of good science, yet current practices
in bioinformatics are falling short of this goal.



The technological tools to facilitate 100% computational reproducibility have been with us for over a
decade and we have seen numerous best-practice articles written over the years expounding various
aspects of computational reproducibility.
In this review article, we describe five key criteria that will act as a touchstone to judge 
bioinformatics reproducibility.
Written in an accessible language, this review is designed to reach a wide audience of both seasoned
and beginner bioinformaticians.
This is a timely contribution as computational irreproducibility has again been in the media [1], and
has been raised as an issue in a recent BiB editorial [2].
