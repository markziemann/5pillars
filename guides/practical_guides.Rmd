The five pillar approach is a synthesis of over a decade of learnings around computational
reproducibility, and contains six key recommendaions and many best practices.
These may be overwhelming for any data scientists, especially beginners and novices,
so here we have tried to put together some recommended resources to enable practitioners to put these
principles into practice.
One of the questions practitioners may have is *"Where do I start?"* and
*"In what order should I learn/master these principles?"*.
The following sections have been arranged in order, and have been submitted to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) for posterity.

## Getting started with data analysis in R and Python

Learn the basics of your scripting language (R/Python/shell) so that you can do useful analyses
with it. Learn by solving problems.

Convert those scripts into literate scripts and document them with introduction, methods,
code comments, results observations and interpretations.
Use JupyterLab (Jupyter notebook) or Rstudio (Rmarkdown) development environments to provide
graphical interfaces to the programming languages.
