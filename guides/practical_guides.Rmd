The five pillar approach is a synthesis of over a decade of learnings around computational
reproducibility, and contains six key recommendaions and many best practices.
These may be overwhelming for any data scientists, especially beginners and novices,
so here we have tried to put together some recommended resources to enable practitioners to put these
principles into practice.
One of the questions practitioners may have is *"Where do I start?"* and
*"In what order should I learn/master these principles?"*.
The following sections have been arranged in order, and have been submitted to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) for posterity.

## Getting started with data analysis in R and Python

Learn the basics of your scripting language (R/Python/shell) so that you can do useful analyses
with it. Learn by solving problems.

## Moving from "dev" to "prod": testing and continuous analysis

Continuous analysis involves automatic execution and testing of code, which is important when changes
are made to code or data.
Results generated in HTML are automatically updated.
Badges on the repository indicate the status of the codebase in terms of completing with or without
errors.
